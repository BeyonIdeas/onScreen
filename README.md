# onScreen

A jQuery plugin that acts when matched elements are visible in the viewport.

We've started this as a simple and minimal plugin for landing pages.



##**Version 0.1**
For now you add a class to selected elements



Basic usage:

    $("element").onScreen();

<br/>
we'll be adding the rest of the options in the coming days.
